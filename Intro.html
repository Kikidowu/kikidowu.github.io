 <h1>Welcome to My first web page. My name is Kikelomo Idowu and this is a little burb about me.</h1>

 <p> I am a learning and development professional that stumbled into this field of work like many others. I work with AWS as a Training Program Manager. I enjoy  being an instructioanl designer because it allows me to connect and serve people in a meaningful way. </p>

<p> I was born and raised in Nigeria. I have a B.Sc. in Sociology. I actually used to be an International Youth Advocate for 6 years, where I educated elected officials and young people on youth health and development policies.</p>

<p>
I recently became a mum and it is by far one of the hardest things I've done as well as the most fulfilling. Motherhood is a joy and I am super grateful I get to love and nuture my little human. </p>


<p>When I am not spending time wih family, you can find me at the mall shopping, hanging out with my girlfriends and having a good conversation about how ghetto adulthood is and how we need to win the lotttery and quit our 9-5 jobs. </p>
